# Q1. What is `NPM`?
- npm is the package manager for Node.js. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.
- The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.
- npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages
- NPM is the default package manager for JavaScript's runtime Node.js.
- It's also known as "Ninja Pumpkin Mutants", "Nonprofit Pizza Makers", and a host of other random names that you can explore and probably contribute to over at npm-expansions(https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions)

### NPM consists of two main parts:
1. a CLI (command-line interface) tool for publishing and downloading packages, and
2. an online repository that hosts JavaScript packages


# Q2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
- Parcel and webpack are the bundlers used mostly for JavaScript or Typescript code that helps you to minify, clean, and make your code compact so that it becomes easier to send a request or receive the response from the server when it usually takes you to transfer multiple files without using any bundler for loading the page of your application.
- Both of these bundlers substantially reduce the time it takes for the transfer of data and files to the server from the application.
- Along with that both bundlers parcel and webpack remove the unnecessary comments, new lines, any kind of block delimiters, and white spaces while the functionality of the code remains unchanged.
